          <p>Almost everyone experiences headaches during their lifetime! Over 50% of the population reports having regular headaches in any given year and rely on repeated analgesics to alleviate the symptoms. According to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD), there are four primary types of headaches - Migraines, Tension-type headaches, Cluster headaches, and other Primary headaches. Additionally, a headache may also be secondary to (be a symptom of) an underlying health problem requiring medical attention. Secondary causes of headaches include head or neck trauma and injuries, stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and vascular malformations.</p>
          
          <p><strong>What are the symptoms of headaches?</strong> <br>
            Symptoms of headaches can be so varied and at the same time so overlapped that it can be difficult to diagnose.
          <ul>
            <li>Throbbing/ deep, dull, achy</li>
            <li>Accompanied by nausea or vomiting</li>
            <li>Sensitivity to light and visual changes</li>
            <li>Distribution and location of pain may vary based on the type of the headache</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Accurate diagnosis of frequent headaches is critical to finding relief when symptoms occur and establishing both a short-term and long-term curative health goal. People suffering from Migraine, Sinus, and Tension headache can at last look forward to normal, productive, and fulfilled lives, following a number of significant medical breakthroughs in the diagnosis and treatment of headaches.</p>
